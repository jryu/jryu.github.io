title: Almond Tuiles
---

I thought finding a recipe for tuiles would be easy, as they seem simple in ingredients and preparation. Surprisingly, expert sources I trust, such as **ATK and NYT**, don't seem to cover them.

Since it’s one of my favorite treats, I **collected and tested 13 recipes**, compared them, and refined them to the most satisfying ratio.

## The Recipe is Simple, But Perfection is Hard to Achieve

- Most tuile recipes have **almost identical ingredients**, differing only slightly in the amounts of sugar and butter, which made **comparison and analysis** straightforward.
- However, when I actually made them, the **thin parts** burned or crumbled, while the **thicker parts** stayed soft and soggy.
- Ultimately, to achieve a high-quality tuile, I had to focus on creating a consistent **thickness** and **shape** more than the recipe's ratio itself.

## 📌 Golden Ratio Tuile Recipe

After lots of testing and trial-and-error, here’s the most satisfying formulation I’ve found:

| Ingredient             | Quantity    | Notes                     |
|------------------------|-------------|---------------------------|
| Cake flour or AP flour | 50g         |                           |
| Egg whites             | 2 large     |                           |
| Sugar                  | 70g         |                           |
| Vanilla Extract        | ½ tsp       |                           |
| Butter                 | 50g         | Use melted butter    |
| Almonds                | To taste    | *Must be toasted in advance*|
| Salt                   | A pinch     |                           |

> **Note:** The recipe is so simple and similar across sources that I've only organized the ingredient ratios here.
>
> I'll consider adding the recipe details (making process, baking temperature, cooling method, etc.) later **if there is interest** 😉

## I Prefer Slivered Almonds

Most recipes use thinly sliced almonds, but after numerous tests, I chose **slivered almonds**.

Sliced almonds have a weak presence when eaten and are difficult to spread evenly over the batter. Slivered almonds, being thicker:

- Have a definitively better **crunch (texture)**, and
- Do not overlap, making it much easier to spread them evenly over the batter.

> **Note:** However, they absolutely must be toasted beforehand.

## The real challenge: spreading it *thin and evenly*

Most recipes simply instruct, "**Spread it lightly with the back of a spoon**." However, this method makes it difficult to achieve a uniform thickness.

- Thin parts **quickly burn or break**
- Thick parts become **underbaked and soggy**
- Resulting in a situation where **half a batch is thrown away** after baking.

To solve this problem, I decided to create a **'template tool.'**

## Making the Tuile Template

### Step 1: Thin plastic cutting board (works, but not ideal)

- I cut holes in a thin plastic cutting board and used it as a stencil.
- The shape was consistent, but **it was too thin to maintain an even thickness.**
- Trying to spread the batter just slightly higher than the board **required too much effort and lacked precision.**

---

### Step 2: Thicker Cutting Board (half success)

- I bought a **thick cutting board** and made another one.
- This made it much easier to spread the batter evenly, and overall quality improved.
- However, I was left with a slight desire for it to be just a little thicker, perhaps by the thickness of a few sheets of paper.

### Step 3: Custom Design with a 3D Printer

- I created a 3D model and was able to **finely adjust the thickness to my exact preference.**
- This resulted in the **cleanest and most satisfying tool** I have ever used.

> ⚠️ **Caution:** Depending on the printing method and material, there may be *food safety concerns*. Be sure to check the **material, washability,** and other factors before use.

## 📝 Final Thoughts

Tuiles, made with truly simple ingredients, become an **elegant cookie** when spread evenly to a **consistent thickness**. Thanks to the template, I can now make them without any waste.
