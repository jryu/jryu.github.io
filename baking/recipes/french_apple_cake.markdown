I usually trust the **ATK (America's Test Kitchen)** recipes completely, but this cake left me wondering, **"Why did they make it this way?"**

At first, I thought I had made a mistake. But even after repeating it a few more times, the result was the same. The **bread texture was too soft and mushy**, and **all the apples floated to the top**, making the texture and appearance unsatisfying.

After comparing and analyzing other recipes, I adjusted a few things and finally achieved a satisfying result:

## I Trusted ATK, But...

- Following the ATK recipe exactly led to a perplexing result: **an excessively moist texture** and **apple pieces that floated**.
- Even after several tries, the result was the same, so I ended up **comparing and analyzing 5 other recipes**.
- This analysis confirmed that the ATK method was **quite unusual**.

---

## Comparison Experiment and Final Choices

### 🧈 1. Cooking Oil vs. Butter
- Among the 5 recipes I compared, ATK was the only one that used **vegetable oil** + **milk** instead of butter.
- Since all the other recipes used **butter**, so I immediately substituted the oil with butter.

---

### 🔪 2. How to Slice the Apples
- Some recipes call for finely diced apples, while others suggest larger chunks.
- This seems to be a matter of personal preference, but I found that **slicing them thinly and lengthwise** provided a better look and texture.

---

### 🥃 3. The Presence and Type of Alcohol
**All** the recipes I compared **use alcohol**.
- ATK added **1 tbsp of Calvados + 1 tsp of lemon juice**.
- Most recipes use **Rum**, with 3 tbsp being the prevailing amount.

## Two Elements Kept from the ATK Recipe

### 📍 Pre-cooking the Apples

- In the ATK method, the sliced apples are **microwaved for 3 minutes**,
  - until they become slightly **translucent**, and
  - are **bendable but don't break**
- They state that skipping this step results in a strange texture because the **apples remain crunchy**, even after the cake is fully baked in the oven.

> 🧪 **Scientific Reason:**
> According to ATK, apples contain an enzyme called **pectin methylesterase (PME)** must be heated above **70°C (160°F)** to be deactivated, which is necessary for the apples to soften.

---

### 📍 Calvados + Lemon Juice Combination

- The **flavor** of the ATK recipe **was excellent.**
- While the texture was problematic, I **wanted to retain the taste**, so I kept the combination of alcohol and lemon juice.

> I believe **Calvados** pairs well it’s made from apples. However, I haven’t tried the rum version yet, so I can’t compare.
>
> Most other recipes only use **3 tbsp of Rum** and **omit the lemon juice**.

The unexpected results from my trusted ATK recipe led me to **explore other recipes** and conduct my **own comparison and modification experiment**.
