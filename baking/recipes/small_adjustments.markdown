These are recipes I started with from America’s Test Kitchen (ATK) but made slight changes to along the way.

> The recipes I followed exactly from ATK are gathered in the [Home Baking Gallery](../gallery).

I've made this recipe **dozens of times**. By preparing the batter the night before, even late risers can enjoy **warm, fresh-baked waffles** in the morning.

- 🔗 [**Original ATK Recipe**](https://www.americastestkitchen.com/recipes/1408-yeasted-waffles)
- ✂️ **My Adjustments**:
  - Reduced the salt **by half**
  - Doubled the sugar **(2x)**

🎥 There’s also a YouTube video:

#### ⚠️ Critical Tip for Making the Batter!

> ❗ The recipe says to *"Cool milk/butter mixture until warm to touch"*, but you must mix the yeast when the **milk is between 100–120℉.** Any hotter, and the yeast will die, and the dough won't ferment.

**Here’s how I do it:**

1. Heat the milk and butter only up to **110–120℉.**
2. Turn off the heat and **cover the pan while you finish the remaining steps.** → The butter will melt naturally.
3. If there are still unmelted pieces, **don’t reheat — whisk until melted.**

💡 **Fun science fact**

> Butter melts around **95℉**, but it **transfers heat very slowly**, so even if the outside starts to melt, the **inside is still cold.**
>
> If you keep heating until all the butter is melted, the mixture will be too hot to mix with the yeast.

### Crêpe Cake
**It was better than Lady M!**

- 🔗 [**Original Recipe**](https://www.americastestkitchen.com/recipes/16387-crepe-cake-with-mixed-berries)
- ✂️ **My Adjustment**:
  - Instead of fruit, I finished the top of the cake with **torched sugar.**

📝 In their [recipe development article](https://www.americastestkitchen.com/articles/8190-a-showstopping-multilayered-crepe-cake-is-easier-to-make-than-you-think), ATK openly mentions the Lady M cake, using the phrase:
> *“topped with brûléed sugar”*

Furthermore, Lady M's official website describes their signature cake:
> *“the top is gently caramelized golden”*

However, the Lady M cake I tasted had such a **weak brûlée effect that it was practically nonexistent.**

So I finished mine like a **crème brûlée, with a crisp torched top**, and everyone loved it. While the appearance might look amateur, I believe the taste was **better than Lady M's.**

### Cranberry Tart
**Excellent filling, but crust needs modification**

- 🔗 [**Original Recipe**](https://www.americastestkitchen.com/recipes/13333-cranberry-curd-tart-with-almond-crust)
- ✂️ **My Adjustment**:
  - Swapped the crust for the one used in the **Lemon Tart recipe.**

Initially, I used the crust made with **100% almond flour** as per the recipe, but it was **so hard I couldn't cut it.** The crust cracked everywhere like an earthquake.

😕 **Personal Assessment:**
A crust made **only with almond flour** and no wheat flour **didn’t taste great and didn’t make sense**. It felt like an attempt to be gluten-free rather than a flavor choice.

So, I replaced it with the **simple crust** from the 🔗 [Lemon–Olive Oil Tart recipe](https://www.americastestkitchen.com/recipes/11432-lemon-olive-oil-tart), and the **texture was softer** and paired well with the filling.

> 💡 It worked because I borrowed the crust from a lemon tart recipe, whose acidity is similar to that of cranberries.
