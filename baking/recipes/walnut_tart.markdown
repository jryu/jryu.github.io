# The Recipe Perfected Through Trial and Error

This is the undeniably best walnut tart recipe. It is better than any I have ever baked or bought.

If you desire a **complex and sophisticated flavor** rather than a plain, sweet, and sticky pecan pie style, you must try this.

## Background: Why Did I Seek a New Recipe?

- *America’s Test Kitchen (ATK)* does have a walnut tart recipe, but it’s practically a pecan pie, making it too sweet and sticky
- To reproduce what I have enjoyed in Korea, I have tried several Korean recipes I found online, but they were largely indistinguishable, differing only slightly in ratios.  
- I also saw the [NYT recipe](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017652-walnut-tart), which involves dissolving sugar to make caramel and then mixing it with cream, but I didn't try it, fearing it would be too heavy and sweet.  

Then, I stumbled upon this recipe 👇

Unlike the traditional caramel + cream method, it adds **egg yolks, butter, and even apple cider vinegar**, to cut through the richness and deepen the flavor. Brilliant.

## 🧁 Records of Failure and Success

### 🥧 Attempt 1
- Followed the recipe exactly  
- **Problem**: The tart shell crumbled, and a lingering taste of vinegar was unpleasant.
- Nevertheless, the complex and deep flavor was impressive, leading to a decision to retry.  

---

### 🥧 Attempt 2
- **Reduced vinegar to 1/3** → much smoother, more balanced flavor.
- Used **half the whole wheat flour** in the shell, but it still crumbled.
- After some research, I found that **trusted tart recipes rarely use whole wheat flour**.

---

### 🥧 Attempt 3
- Same filling as Attempt 2  
- Switched to a classic **Pâte Sucrée** for the tart shell → **successfully held together**  
- Downside: The shell’s sweetness felt slightly separate from the filling  

---

### 🥧 Attempt 4 ✅ **Breakthrough!**
- Used a recipe that mixes **almond flour** into the shell (Pâte Sucrée aux Amandes)
  - The nuttiness was enhanced, and the sweetness blended naturally.  
  - Followed the ATK chocolate tart recipe.

- When making caramel, I have **browned the melted butter** before adding other ingredients.
  - This created a **rich, Scotch candy–like depth of flavor**

- You can use a **pie shield** to prevent the shell’s edges from burning. The taste isn't significantly different without it, but it improves presentation.
