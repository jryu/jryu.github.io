After trying various *America’s Test Kitchen (ATK)* white bread recipes, I found that **American bread couldn't compare to the fluffy loaves from Korean bakeries.** 

Finally, I have refined this sandwich bread recipe over multiple years, which I can honestly say is **"Better than any sandwitch bread I've ever tasted!"**

## Background: It All Started with the NYT Recipe

- I had tried several *ATK* bread recipes but found that **the results never justified the effort.**
- Then I came across [**New York Times’ Milk Bread recipe**](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1016275-japanese-milk-bread).
- Using the **tangzhong** method gave the **interior a unique moistness**, and the **crust had a wonderful texture**.
- It was the first time I thought, "**This might actually be better than the Korean bakery bread** I grew up with."

Since my family loved it, I kept making it, and because it became the most frequently baked bread, I continuously sought improvements. 👇

## Years of Refinement: Finding the **Golden Ratio**

### 🍞 Step 1: First **Adjustment**
- The biggest problem with the original NYT recipe was that **it was too sweet**.
- I **cut the sugar in half**, and → the flavor became much more balanced and satisfying.

### 🍞 Step 2: Adding Whole Wheat for **Depth of Flavor**
**Applied ATK Tip:** I learned that substituting up to **15% of the total flour with whole wheat** has minimal impact on the texture.
- I replaced **10% (70g) with whole wheat flour** → the plain white bread gained a **complex flavor** profile, completing a richer taste
> *Tip: Since whole wheat flour is used in such small amounts and spoils quickly, I store it in the freezer.*

### 🍞 Step 3 ✅ The **Golden Ratio** Complete
- While experimenting with hamburger bun recipes (still not fully satisfied with those 😅), I've learned the point where **fluffiness** was maximized based on the **egg/butter ratio**.
- I tried applying that ratio to my sandwich bread recipe, and it worked!
  - **Halved the eggs** (2 → 1)
  - **reduced butter to ¾** (8 Tbsp → 6 Tbsp).  
- The bread's flavor and aroma remained unchanged, but the texture significantly improved.

## 📌 Final Recipe

This is the optimized recipe for my family's palate, perfected after using over a pound of yeast through countless trials.

### Tangzhong (same as the original recipe)

| Ingredient | Amount |
| :--- | :--- |
| Bread Flour | 45 g |
| Milk | 1/2 cup |
| Water | 1/2 cup |

### Dough (Final Ratio)

| Ingredient | Amount | Adjustment |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Bread Flour | 580 g | Reduced to account for whole wheat |
| **Whole Wheat Flour** | **70 g** | **Flavor added (10% substitution)** |
| **Sugar** | **60 g** | **1/2 of the original recipe** |
| Yeast | 1 tbsp | |
| **Egg** | **1** | **1/2 of the original recipe** |
| Milk | 7/8 cup | |
| Salt | 2 tsp | |
| **Butter** | **6 tbsp** | **¾ of the original recipe** |

> **Tip 1:** I use **King Arthur** brand flour. If using other flours, you may need to adjust the milk quantity slightly.

> **Tip 2:** Follow the same procedure as in the [NYT recipe](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1016275-japanese-milk-bread), but I use **the entire tangzhong** to make **two loaves**.

## Optional: Pullman Pan vs. Loaf Pan

After I started developing this recipe, [**ATK released their Shokupan (Japanese White Bread) recipe**](https://www.americastestkitchen.com/recipes/14709-shokupan-japanese-white-bread).  
It’s plain and firm, practical for sandwiches, but still lacks that “wow” factor.

However, that recipe prompted me to start using a **Pullman Pan**.

![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53348238246_cbf2163261_w.jpg)

- **Pros:** Every slice is uniform in size, making sandwich making very convenient.
- **Cons:** The crust does not harden, which reduces the appealing texture.

> *Tip:* Because each has pros and cons, I still alternate between the two pans depending on my mood.

### Pullman Pan Tips

- Use the same golden-ratio dough as above.
- Divide the dough into **4 equal portions**, each weighing **8.5 oz**.
- To brown the crust, I **open the lid about 10 minutes before the bread is done**. However, sliding the lid at that stage can easily ruin the loaf. To prevent that, I **invert the lid** and **place another pan on top as a weight** while it bakes.

## 📝 Closing Thoughts

The reason I made this bread so many times—using over a pound of yeast—is simply because **my family absolutely loves it.**

By incorporating tips from ATK, drawing inspiration from my hamburger bun experiments, and continuously improving the recipe, I have finally created this golden ratio, which I am now happy to share with you as well.
