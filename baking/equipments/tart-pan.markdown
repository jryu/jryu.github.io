## 🍑 Fresh Fruit Tart 🫐

There are quite a few people who love lemonade but dislike the sourness of lemon in baking.

However, I have never met anyone who dislikes the flavor of this fruit tart.

It’s a bit more work, but absolutely worth making, and you don’t need expensive equipment.

🔗 [The written recipe is here](https://www.americastestkitchen.com/recipes/9725-fresh-fruit-tart), and the video is freely available, so I'm sharing it:

**There are tools for juicing lemons and limes, but using your hands is perfectly fine!**

I ended up buying one eventually, but if you’re still figuring out whether baking suits you, there’s no need to rush.
  * When squeezing by hand, you may get a smaller amount, so prepare 1–2 more than the recipe calls for.
  * After halving them, press firmly with both hands. That’s enough.

> 🌟 **And be sure to strain out the seeds and pulp using a [fine-mesh strainer](../equipments/essentials#fine-mesh-strainer), which is one of the [essential tools](../equipments/essentials)!**
