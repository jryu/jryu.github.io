A **Springform Pan** is useful for making delicate or fragile cakes because the sides can be removed without having to invert the cake.

- 💰 Price: $16–50  
- 🔗 [ATK Review](https://www.americastestkitchen.com/equipment_reviews/1656-springform-pans)  
- 🛒 [Recommended Product on Amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000237FSA)

Later, if you get a **stand mixer**, you can use the pan for recipes like **cheesecake**, but for now, I'm introducing a recipe you can make without any additional equipment.

## 🍏 French Apple Cake

I have quite a bit to say about this recipe, so I created a 🔗 [**separate page**](../recipes/french_apple_cake) for it.

It includes steps that improve on the shortcomings of the ATK recipe, along with the wonderfully satisfying result.

I'm familiar with apple tarts and apple pies, but I had never tried an apple cake before making this one.

Everyone I shared it with was also new to it, and we were all surprised by the subtle, sophisticated flavor they weren’t expecting, and I was the most surprised of all!

It might be hard to imagine the taste just from the picture. You should definitely try making it yourself! 😄
