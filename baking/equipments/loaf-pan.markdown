When ATK (America’s Test Kitchen) labels a recipe **Ultimate** is not just an ordinary recipe. It means that even for a common recipe, the recipe **makes a significant difference**.

This banana bread recipe is no exception. Perfectly sweet, moist, and rich in banana flavor... it is truly a **perfected** recipe.

> 🔗 The [ATK recipe](https://www.americastestkitchen.com/recipes/6067-ultimate-banana-bread) is normally for paid members only, but it is **freely available on YouTube**! The beginning of the video contains information about bananas, and the **actual recipe explanation starts in the middle**.

> 👇 I’ve created a link that starts the video right at the recipe section.

## Tip: No Potato Masher Needed!

The recipe calls for a **Potato Masher**, but once you microwave the bananas as instructed in the recipe, they become very soft, and you can **mash them sufficiently with a fork or a whisk.**

So, as long as you have a loaf pan, this is still a very **beginner-friendly recipe**! 😉
