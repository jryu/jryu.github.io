## Kitchen Scale
**💰 Price $10-50**

Since measuring flour by volume can lead to large errors, it's best to measure by weight.

If a recipe lists both volume and weight, I recommend measuring by weight.

## Wire Rack
**💰 Price $10-15**

Always cool freshly baked bread or cookies on a wire rack. If placed directly on a plate, moisture cannot escape, making them soggy.

> 💡 After frying foods like pancakes or cutlets, let them rest on a wire rack for extra crispiness.

## Baking Sheet (Rimmed)
**💰 Price $10-15**

Used for cookies, nuts, and other items baked in the oven without a separate pan.

Since it is often used with a wire rack, it's good to get a product that fits perfectly. The ATK-recommended product fits just right.
