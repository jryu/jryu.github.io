## Which Product Should I Choose?

The top-tier product selected by ATK is very high quality, but it **costs $50** and can only be purchased from their own website.

However! **The USA Pan product is made by the same manufacturer** that produced this top-tier pan. Only the brand name is different; the performance and durability are nearly identical, but the price is much more reasonable. **If you prioritize value for money, the USA Pan is a great alternative.**

- 💰 Price: $20–50

If pecan pie is too sweet for you, this recipe is a great alternative.

Instead of being completely filled with filling, the **pecans feel lightly coated**, which makes it less sweet and gives it a wonderful texture.

It might look like the pecans will fall off when you cut it, but **surprisingly, they hold together well.**

ATK has several brownie recipes, but this one stands out for its **irresistibly chewy** texture.

It is **completely** different from boxed brownie mixes, and it is a recipe **worth challenging yourself with** by starting from scratch with flour.
