title: "Rae Lakes Loop"

Two years after I began hiking with the dream of completing the JMT, I finally walked a section of that journey — the **Rae Lakes Loop**.

Starting at 5,000 feet and crossing a pass almost 12,000 feet, this route embraces **a wide variety of landscapes** — waterfalls, meadows, lakes, and alpine valleys. It’s also special in that you can experience both above and below the tree line.

The saying that this is *“one of the most beloved loop trails in the Sierra Nevada”* is no exaggeration. The more places I visit, the more I appreciate the **diversity of scenery** this trail offers.

The photo above shows an **unnamed meadow near Woods Creek**. It’s still before joining the JMT and is not even marked on the map — yet for me, it was one of the most memorable spots of the entire loop, along with **Rae Lake** and **Glen Pass**.

This is the kind of view that unfolds once you pass the tree line.

## 🏔 Glen Pass

The highest point — **Glen Pass (11,926 ft)** — was both the **highlight and the toughest section** of this trek.

I’d been feeling unwell since the previous day and could barely eat. Dehydration made my voice crack, and the final mile took me **two full hours** to climb.  

Even more distressingly, I had an urgent biological need in the middle of the climb — but there were no trees or bushes to hide behind, so I just had to endure it. Looking back now, it was a typical sign of **altitude sickness**, though at the time I was too inexperienced to realize it.

## 🐻 Fleeting Moments

On the way up, I spotted a **bear climbing a tree**, and on the way down, I captured photos of various **wildflowers**.

📷 There were too many photos to include here, so I’ve shared them separately in [this Facebook link](https://www.facebook.com/junho.ryu.9/posts/pfbid037FGMNU3q6rN2SA72A5RT22perRqinDKLtH5umGmeohiVq9xnm8qDRDJgLzZH3o2Jl).

## 📝 Trail Info

You’ll need to reserve a permit in advance from [Sequoia and Kings Canyon Wilderness](https://www.recreation.gov/permits/445857).  
- For the **clockwise** direction, choose the `Woods Creek` entry permit.  
- For **counterclockwise**, select `Bubbs Creek`.

> 💡 If you want to **gain elevation gradually**, the clockwise route is easier on the body.

You can check the full trail map and elevation profile on [AllTrails — Rae Lakes Loop](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/rae-lakes-loop--3).

## Final Thoughts

The Rae Lakes Loop overlaps with about **5% of the JMT**. Comparing the scenery and atmosphere of the approach and exit trails gave me a glimpse into why the JMT is so renowned.

I hope to have the opportunity to walk the rest of the segments someday.
