Introducing a backpacking route that connects two of the most iconic viewpoints in Yosemite National Park — **Half Dome** and **Clouds Rest**

**Half Dome** is so famous that it’s often listed as a bucket-list hike for countless climbers and hikers ✨

**Clouds Rest**, another breathtaking spot, offers a thrilling experience of walking along a narrow ridge. The excitement can’t be fully captured in a photo — check out the 360° video below to feel the dizzying exposure for yourself 👇

There’s also a video of the climb up the Half Dome cables:

## 🥾 Reduce the Burden of a Day Trip and Enjoy More Scenery

The round trip to the summit of Half Dome covers over 16 miles with an elevation gain of more than 5,300 feet — **too strenuous to comfortably complete in a single day** 😮‍💨

So I obtained a **backpacking permit** and completed the route over **two days and one night**. This wasn’t just to avoid challenge — it was to start from a higher elevation and take in more of the scenery at a relaxed pace

Starting from **Tenaya Lake**, I passed through **Clouds Rest** and continued to the summit of **Half Dome**. Thanks to this route, I was able to reduce the overall burden of the climb:

## 🌲 A Night on the John Muir Trail

While looking for the optimal base camp for climbing Half Dome the next day, I naturally ended up spending a night right on the **John Muir Trail (JMT)**.

I’ve visited many backpacking campsites over the years, but this spot was on a different level. The area was perfectly partitioned by large fallen logs, the ground was wide and flat, and a stream flowed right alongside it. It was surprising to find such a **prime spot** hidden deep in the forest without any official signage.

This location would be an excellent **first-night campsite for JMT hikers** heading south from **Happy Isles**. Especially if you plan to detour to **Half Dome**, it would be difficult for most hikers to push much farther than this after such a demanding climb.

While my saved photos contain the exact coordinates, the map above provides a clear enough hint for the location.

After spending the night here, I summited Half Dome, returned to camp to pack up, and finished the journey with a pleasant 7-mile descent along the JMT.

## 🎫 Permit Information

There are only **seven trailhead options** that allow backpackers to climb Half Dome. If you’d like to take on this special route, be sure to visit the
