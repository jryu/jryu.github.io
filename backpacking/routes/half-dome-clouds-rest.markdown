Introducing a backpacking route that connects two of the most iconic viewpoints in Yosemite National Park — **Half Dome** and **Clouds Rest**

**Half Dome** is so famous that it’s often listed as a bucket-list hike for countless climbers and hikers ✨

**Clouds Rest**, another breathtaking spot, offers a thrilling experience of walking along a narrow ridge. The excitement can’t be fully captured in a photo — check out the 360° video below to feel the dizzying exposure for yourself 👇

## 🥾 Reduce the Burden of a Day Trip and Enjoy More Scenery

The round trip to the summit of Half Dome covers over 16 miles with an elevation gain of more than 5,300 feet — **too strenuous to comfortably complete in a single day** 😮‍💨

So I obtained a **backpacking permit** and completed the route over **two days and one night**. This wasn’t just to avoid challenge — it was to start from a higher elevation and take in more of the scenery at a relaxed pace

Starting from **Tenaya Lake**, I passed through **Clouds Rest** and continued to the summit of **Half Dome**. Thanks to this route, I was able to reduce the overall burden of the climb:
