title: Narrows Top Down
---

**The Narrows (Top-Down)** is a 16-mile journey along the canyon floor of Zion National Park — a truly unique hike where you walk *through* the river itself.  

The river, narrowly carving a path between the towering cliffs, provides a deep sense of immersion in a quiet landscape granted to only **12 groups per day**.

Because it had been a dry year, I worried the river might feel underwhelming — but that concern quickly vanished.

By the time I reached the campsite about 10 miles in and started pitching my tent, I felt dizzy every time I stood up. It reminded me of how I’d felt years ago after crossing **Glen Pass** on the **Rae Lakes Loop**.

Walking through the current over rounded, slippery rocks — instead of on flat ground — had clearly taken its toll. I even thought that if the water had been any deeper, I might not have made it. 💦

## An Immersion in Solitude: Only 12 Groups a Day

Only **12 groups per day** are granted permits for this route, and everyone must hike **Top-Down**. As a result, I met just two other groups all day — the canyon felt peaceful and almost entirely my own.

The evening I spent on the broad rock in front of **Campsite #4** is a memory I’ll never forget. No mosquitoes, no chill — just perfect weather for lying back and stargazing. Every element of that night felt ideal.

## Practical Considerations

However, there are two key differences from typical backpacking that you must know in advance:

- **💧 Drinking Water**  
  Since my first Zion visit, the river water has been contaminated with **toxic cyanobacteria (blue-green algae)**, so **the water is unsafe to drink even after filtering**. I carried **4.5 L**, and after breakfast the next morning, only about 500 mL remained.  

  > ✅ Fortunately, you can safely refill at **Big Springs (mile 11.5)**, though most hikers reach it on the second morning.

- **🚽 Waste Disposal**  
  You must **pack out all human waste** from the canyon. Urination, however, is permitted directly into the river. Waste-carry kits can be purchased in advance or at the permit office when you pick up your pass.

## ⛺ Permit Tips & Campsite Info

- **Odd-numbered campsites** → available for online reservation  
- **Even-numbered campsites** → issued only in person on the day of pickup  

I reserved an odd-numbered site online and went to pick up my permit at **3 p.m. the day before the hike**. Surprisingly, none of the even-numbered sites had been claimed yet. This was even during the peak season in July ☀️

> According to the staff, even campsites that can accommodate more people are **assigned exclusively to a single group**. 👍

## Final Thoughts

I thought the downhill nature would make it easy, but it was harder than a regular uphill climb. However, the experience of **walking through the middle of the water and between the canyons** is unlike anything else. 

Photos and videos never capture the reality of the scenery anywhere you go, but the difference is particularly stark here. Due to the canyon's nature, sunlight doesn't penetrate well, so the camera cannot properly capture the texture or the depth. 

You truly have to walk it yourself to feel that overwhelming sense of awe. **I wholeheartedly agree that it's called a bucket list trip for a reason.**
