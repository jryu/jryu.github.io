**💦 Green water** and **🏜️ red canyons** create an exotic contrast of colors.

I had seen many photos, but the contrast when it unfolded before my eyes in reality was far more vivid.

Usually, I describe my hike using these expressions: *awe-inspiring*, *moving*, or *difficult but rewarding*, but this place was different. The words that came to mind first were **“It was so much fun 😄”**

- **Mooney Falls**, steeper than Angel’s Landing ⛰️  
- **Beaver Falls**, which feels like a natural waterpark 💧  

It was a course full of both adventure and playfulness.

Another thing that left a strong impression was **the makeup of the people there**. In most high-altitude backpacking trips, there’s a noticeable **male-dominant ratio**, but here, that imbalance didn’t exist here.

There were multiple groups of **middle-aged women**, which you rarely see, and I thought,  
> “This is a place that appeals to everyone, regardless of age or gender.”

Even my **teenage daughter 💕**, after watching the photos and videos I brought back said,
> When I become an adult, I want to go there with a backpack myself.”

Here’s the video I showed her 🎥:

## 🌤️ A Chance Created by Timing

Getting a Havasupai permit is **very competitive and quite expensive 💰**

While following the [official Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/HavasupaiTribeTourismOfficial/), I happened to see a post announcing the **reopening of the Lodge after renovation, 🏠** and luckily managed to book a **room with a bed and shower 🚿**

> Normally, reservations for the entire year sell out as soon as they open, but since the announcement came without prior notice, I was able to book leisurely.

## ☀️ Weather, Water Temperature — All Conditions Were Perfect

I went in **mid-October 🍂**, when the daytime high was **88°F (31°C)**.  
- **If it had been hotter**, the hike back would’ve been miserable;  
- **if it had been colder**, we wouldn’t have been able to enjoy the water.

The water temperature felt like **an unheated California pool in autumn**: 
> It is by no means a temperature you can comfortably stay in for a long time. You get cold quickly without sunlight, and I wonder if I could even get in if it were any cooler than this.

## In Closing

Havasupai was **a special place that added a sense of “fun” to backpacking**. It was a journey that made me imagine a day when I might **walk through that canyon again with my daughter, both of us wearing backpacks**.
