Famous for its **emerald-colored lakes**, **Big Pine Lakes** is one of the most sought-after destinations among the **[Inyo Wilderness permits](https://www.recreation.gov/permits/233262)**. 

To visit, you’ll need to reserve the **Big Pine Creek North Fork** trailhead.

No matter how many photos you’ve seen, the colors that appear before your eyes are far more vivid and breathtaking.

> The turquoise color of the lake water is due to the meltwater from the **Palisade Glacier** — the largest glacier in the Sierra Nevada and the **southernmost permanent glacier** in the continental U.S.

Even though it was late in the season (around late September) and water levels were generally low due to ongoing drought, the lake level remained steady and the creeks were still flowing vigorously.

This was my **second backpacking trip**, and my **first overnight camp** above 10,000 ft (3,000 m) in the Sierra Nevada 🏕️. 

I was truly thrilled to pitch my tent in a spot right overlooking the lake.

## Experiencing Altitude Sickness for the First Time 🏔️

I thought I was used to hiking above 3,000 m on day trips, but spending **a full night at altitude** was a completely different experience.

In the middle of the night, I suddenly woke up with nausea and shortness of breath 😵‍💫 Thankfully, I had packed some motion-sickness medicine, and after taking it, I was able to get back to sleep.

## What I'd Like to Do Next Time ✨

Due to time and energy limits, I couldn’t make it all the way to the glacier this time — and that remains my biggest regret 🥲.

When I return, I’d like to:

* Spend a night first at the **[Big Pine Creek Campground](https://www.recreation.gov/camping/campgrounds/232305)** right by the trailhead to acclimate to the altitude.
* Take a **two-night trip** along the trail so I can hike to the **Palisade Glacier** at a relaxed pace.

### 📝 A Few Notes From the Trail

- **Sixth Lake** involves about a 2-mile round-trip detour with some climbing, but it wasn’t particularly impressive.  
  **Stopping at Fifth Lake and heading back** might be enough.

- I later realized that most of the iconic “postcard” shots were actually taken **just off the trail near Second Lake**, where **Temple Crag** stands perfectly behind the lake — the best photo spot 📸. I regret walking past it without stopping!

- **Black Lake** seemed relatively ordinary, perhaps because it's not fed by glacial water. While going via Black Lake is the shortest route to descend after seeing Fifth Lake, but **if you have the time and energy, descending the same way you came offers far better scenery**.
