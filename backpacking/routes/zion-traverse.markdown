🎂 For my **40th birthday**, I went on my very first **backpacking trip**.

If I were to do it by myself, I probably wouldn’t have dared to try it, but thanks to the kindness and experience of friends I’ve known since my time at the Seoul office,  I received a lot of help and was able to finish the whole trail.

## Most Memorable Moment

The moment that left the deepest impression was at the **campsite on the West Rim** ⛺️ where you can watch both the **sunset** and **sunrise**.

Eating a bowl of **tuna kimchi ramen 🍜** was like a gift that fully rewarded the tiring and difficult day.

## Route Info & Links

The Zion Traverse route I walked can be seen on the [AllTrails](https://www.alltrails.com/explore/map/zion-traverse-lee-pass-to-east-rim-trailhead-2b515e2).

If your goal is only the ridge with the most impressive campsite, it might be enough to do this course **in reverse as a 2-day, 1-night** ⏱️

> 🤔 If you’re wondering whether the full traverse is worth it, check out the video below.

> The **initial 1/3** of the video covers a 2-night itinerary, and the **latter 2/3** covers the final 1-night itinerary (West Rim).

## Closing Thoughts

If a **day hike** is like watching a **movie 🎥**, then **backpacking** is like **binge-watching a season of a drama 📺**.

The scenes that would have been edited out in a movie — the walking, eating, and sleeping — all become **part of the story** in backpacking.

Unlike a crowded theater where you sit among countless strangers, backpacking was a completely different genre of travel, like **enjoying a drama with comfortable companions**.
