title: Four Pass Loop
---

The Four Pass Loop is one of the most highly-regarded backpacking courses in Colorado for its 🍁 **autumn foliage views**. The trail crosses **four mountain passes**, each over 12,000 feet high.

This was my **third 4-day backpacking trip**. Compared to other routes I’ve done, the **total elevation gain** was similar — but since the **overall distance was much shorter**, I thought this hike would feel more relaxed.

But that was wishful thinking. A **shorter distance means steeper climbs**, and since the **overall altitude is higher**, this was the trip where I suffered the most from altitude sickness among all the hikes I've been on.

> I’ll save the altitude sickness whining for later, but first, let me share the good stories.

## 🍁 Perfect Timing for Fall Colors

Just like cherry blossoms, **catching peak autumn foliage** is all about timing — and thanks to the person who planned this trip, our timing was absolutely perfect.

- On the first day, the colors were about **70–80% turned**,  
- and by the final day of our 4-day hike, the foliage was at **its peak**.

The scenery at **Snowmass Lake** was especially breathtaking — the deep blue water and the golden leaves created a magical combination.

These colors are hard to find in California. This lake is **over 8 miles up from the trailhead**, so visiting it on a backpacking trip was well worth the effort.

## 🥵 Altitude Sickness Was No Joke

I had no issues at the **first pass**. “Hey, I’m feeling great today!” I thought as I crossed it easily.

But by the **second and third passes**, symptoms of altitude sickness started to hit. I lost my appetite and couldn’t eat, barely managing to suck on a piece of candy.

Interestingly, since **all four passes are around 12,000 feet** above sea level, the altitude itself is similar. The fact that I was fine on the first pass shows that **altitude sickness is not just an altitude**. It is also **affected by accumulated fatigue and physical condition**.

Thankfully, by the **final pass**, I seemed to have somewhat acclimated to the altitude, giving me enough composure to take beautiful photos like the one above.

## 👥 A Journey Made Possible by Companionship

There were **eight of us** on this trip. We split into two groups — one faster and one slower — and each hiked at our own pace.

I was in the second group, while the person who filmed the video was in the first, so I only appear briefly on the first and last days.

## 📌 Recommended Day Hikes to Enjoy Peak Fall Colors

Even if hiking the **entire 25-mile loop** sounds daunting, the **most scenic fall foliage sections** can easily be enjoyed **as day hikes**.

### 1) Stroll Around Maroon Lake

📍 Located right at the trailhead — and though I hate to admit it — this area was **even more stunning than any place we saw during the 4-day trek**.

### 2) Overlook with a View of Crater Lake

From Maroon Lake, **hike just 1.5 miles further** to reach a **wide-open viewpoint** where you can look down on the aspen forest.

> As you head toward Crater Lake, skip the junction that descends to the lake and continue a bit higher — that’s where the best view is.

## Final Thoughts

The fall colors were breathtaking, but after seeing **photos of this area in spring and summer**, it almost feels like an entirely different world.

Now I dream of returning someday to hike the **Four Pass Loop in its lush green season**, and maybe even exploring other famous Colorado routes like **Chicago Basin**.
